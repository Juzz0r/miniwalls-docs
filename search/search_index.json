You only need it when you want to enable economy (players receive currency for kills, can buy kits for in-game currency etc)\n\n\n\n\nIf you have BungeeCord or Lilypad server it\u2019s recommended to create a separate server to run MiniWalls. If you can\u2019t create a separate server for MiniWalls it\u2019s not recommended to run other games on this server as they may conflict with MiniWalls.\n\n\nInstalling plugin\n\n\n\n\nDownload the plugin from Spigot\n\n\nCopy plugin jar (for example MiniWalls.jar or whatever the plugin's version is) to your server plugins directory\n\n\nStart server\n\n\nLook for any errors in console. If there are any your server probably doesn't meet all the prerequisites. If you can't figure out why you're having errors and can't fix them contact me by PM on Spigot and I will help you out.\n\n\nStop server\n\n\nConfigure the config files (tutorial below) (This step is optional. If your server meets all prerequisites you are ready to use the plugin)\n\n\nStart the server and have fun!\n\n\n\n\nConfiguration files\n\n\nWith MiniWalls come quite a few configuration files. They are located in plugin's main directory \nplugins/MiniWalls\n.\n\n\nThere are 4 files in total - \nconfig.json\n, \nkits.json\n, \nmaps.json\n and \nen.properties\n. Files ending with .json use JSON syntax and \nen.properties\n uses Java .properties syntax.\n\n\nJSON\n\n\n\n\nIntroduction and Syntax\n\n\nOnline validator (check if your file follows syntax)\n\n\n\n\n.properties\n\n\n\n\nIntroduction and Syntax\n\n\n\n\nData types\n\n\nIn JSON configuration files there is a data type for every configuration value. That means that each item/key needs a specific value. For example \ncurrencyPerKill\n in economy config needs a value which is an integer, but \nenabled\n in the same config needs a boolean value (true or false). Here is a table of all data types currently in use in config files.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData type\n\n\nValue\n\n\nExample\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nboolean\n\n\ntrue or false\n\n\ntrue\n\n\n\n\n\n\nstring\n\n\na sequence of characters\n\n\n\"hey that's a string\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\ninteger\n\n\nan integer\n\n\n15\n\n\n\n\n\n\nnumber\n\n\nan integer or floating point number\n\n\n7.25\n\n\n\n\n\n\nduration\n\n\nduration in milliseconds\n\n\n15000\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmaterial\n\n\nminecraft material name string, \nclick here\n for 1.13 materials, \nhere\n for 1.8-1.12.\n\n\n\"diamond_pickaxe\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nchat color\n\n\nminecraft color string, \nclick here\n for list\n\n\n\"\nc\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nitemstack\n\n\nMinecraft item as JSON object containing \nmaterial\n, \namount\n, \ndata\n and \nunbreakable\n\n\n{\"material\": \"wool\",\"data\": 14, \"amount\": 64}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nitemstack.material\n\n\nmaterial of the itemstack\n\n\nsee above - material\n\n\n\n\n\n\nitemstack.amount\n\n\ninteger size of itemstack (optional, default 1)\n\n\nsee above - integer\n\n\n\n\n\n\nitemstack.data\n\n\ninteger data/durability of itemstack (optional, default 0)\n\n\nsee above - integer\n\n\n\n\n\n\nitemstack.unbreakable\n\n\nboolean value whether itemstack is unbreakable (optional, default false)\n\n\nsee above - boolean\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlocation\n\n\nJSON object containing x, y and z coordinates\n\n\n{\"x\": 147, \"y\": 64.5, \"z\": -1024}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlocation.x, location.y, location.z,\n\n\nnumber value of the coordinate\n\n\nsee above - number\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncuboid\n\n\nJSON object containing bounds of cuboid\n\n\n{\"loc1\": {\"x\": 15, \"y\": 0, \"z\": -25.5}, \"loc2\": {\"x\": 768, \"y\": 25, \"z\": 400}}\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncuboid.loc1, cuboid.loc2\n\n\nlocation of bound\n\n\nsee above - location\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneral Config\n\n\nGeneral config is in \nconfig.json\n file and contains most of the settings of the MiniWalls plugin.

Every arena has its own players, world etc. Arenas are configured in main config file \nconfig.json\n. They are set in an array \narenas\n.\n\n\nEvery JSON object in \narenas\n contains a setting \nname\n. The data type of this setting is \nstring\n.\n\n\nname\n is the only setting you need to set for every arena. For example arena JSON object can look like \n{\"name\": \"MyAwesomeArena\"}\n\n\nSettings\n\n\nBy default, settings for the arena are taken from default config that can be configured in the same file (\nconfig.json\n). Default arena config is an object named \narena\n. It needs to contain all of the settings in the table below.\n\n\nYou can also set custom settings for each arena by adding a new object \nconfig\n to arena object. This object can contain settings of the following table. Custom settings override default settings.\n\n\nFor example, in an example below, arena \nMiniWalls-2\n always has a \nstartDelay\n 33333, no matter what it's in default config. However, this only applies to arena \nMiniWalls-2\n, all other arenas that don't have \nstartDelay\n, have a default value.\n\n\n{ \"name\": \"MiniWalls-2\", \"config\": { \"startDelay\": 33333 } }\n\n\nArena Settings\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nkey\n\n\nvalue type\n\n\ndefault\n\n\nexplanation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nstartDelay\n\n\nduration\n\n\n45000\n\n\nduration after game starts when arena has atleast players specified in \nminPlayers\n\n\n\n\n\n\nserverFullStartDelay\n\n\nduration\n\n\n10000\n\n\nduration after game starts when arena is full\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwallsTime\n\n\nduration\n\n\n15000\n\n\nduration after walls drop\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndeathmatchTime\n\n\nduration\n\n\n180000\n\n\nduration after deathmatch begins since start of the game\n\n\n\n\n\n\nshrinkTime\n\n\nduration\n\n\n200000\n\n\nduration after map starts to shrink since start of the game\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmaxTime\n\n\nduration\n\n\n300000\n\n\nmax duration that game can last\n\n\n\n\n\n\nminPlayers\n\n\ninteger\n\n\n8\n\n\nminimum amount of players with what game can begin\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmaxPlayers\n\n\ninteger\n\n\n16\n\n\nmaximum amount of players\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmaxSpectators\n\n\ninteger\n\n\n24\n\n\nmaximum amount of spectators\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmaps\n\n\narray of strings\n\n\nforest, volcano\n\n\nnames of maps that are in arena\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStorage\n\n\nBy default Mini Walls stores players' data (stats and unlocked kits) in directory \nplugins/MiniWalls/db\n. You can change the storage type in the general config (see above - General config).\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\nIf you change the storage type, data from the previous type isn't migrated to a new one. It means that you lose all the data when you change the storage type.\n\n\n\n\nTeams\n\n\nTeams are configured in \nconfig.json\n file. They are set in an array \nteams\n that contains team JSON objects. Below is an explanation of the team JSON object.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nkey\n\n\nvalue type\n\n\nexplanation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nname\n\n\nstring\n\n\nname of the team; this needs to match the wither name in map config (\nSee Maps\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndisplayName\n\n\nstring\n\n\nname that is displayed to players\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncolor\n\n\nchat color\n\n\ncolor of the team; in that color is sometimes the \ndisplayName\n; on that depends the armor and wool color\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKits\n\n\nAll Mini Walls players have a kit. Each kit is sort of a \"custom skill\". With every kit come items that player gets every time he or she spawns or continuously. Kits are configured in \nkits.json\n file. That files contains an array of kit JSON objects.

Maps are configured in \nmaps.json\n file. That file contains an array of map JSON objects.

You can do it in Minecraft singleplayer or in any server you have access to. Be sure that your map has the following elements that Mini Walls needs:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwalls that separate the teams.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nplace for each wither (there are 4 withers by default)\n\n\n\n\n\n\na lobby area that players spawn in before the game begins; it disappears when the game begins\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopying the files\n\n\nThe next step is to copy the map that you have built to the Mini Walls server. Copy the whole folder and place it in \nplugins/MiniWalls\n directory.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nThis name is not shown to players and is used only when configuring the plugin.\n\n\n\n\nStarting the setup\n\n\nIf you haven't already, start your Mini Walls server and join the game. Make sure that you have \nwalls.admin.map-setup\n permission.\n\n\nUse \n/mw ms create yourMapName\n command in-game to start the setup. Replace \nyourMapName\n with the name that you set earlier, for example if your directory name was map-sandcastle, the command should \n/mw ms create sandcastle\n.\n\n\nAfter that you should get a message on how to teleport to the setup world. Use the given command to teleport to setup world. Usually it is something like \n/mw ms tp MwSetup-mapName-1\n.\n\n\nSetting the display name\n\n\nDisplay name is the name of the map that is shown to players. To change it, use the following command while in setup world: \n/mw ms display_name MapName\n.\n\n\nSetting the lobby spawn\n\n\nPlayers that join the game are automatically teleported to lobby spawn location. This location can be changed using \n/mw ms lobby_spawn\n command. This command changes the lobby spawn location to your current location.\n\n\nSetting the lobby area\n\n\nThe area that players can be in before the game starts, can be set using command \n/mw ms lobby_area\n. After entering the command, left click the boundaries of the lobby area. Selecting the area works the same as WorldEdit's, but it doesn't matter which item you click with. More information on WorldEdit selection can be found at \nhttp://wiki.sk89q.com/wiki/WorldEdit/Selection#Selecting_cuboids\n.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nAfter the game starts, all blocks in lobby area are replaced with air.\n\n\n\n\nSetting the spectator spawn\n\n\nWhen players die or join during the game, they are first teleported to the spectator spawn location. This location can be changed with \n/mw ms spectator_spawn\n. This command changes the spectator spawn location to your current location.\n\n\nSetting the border\n\n\nPlayers can't move outside the map border. The area that players can be in, can be set using command \n/mw ms border\n. It uses the same selection method as previously explained lobby area command.\n\n\nAdding walls\n\n\nTo add new walls, use \n/mw ms wall add\n command and select the boundaries of the wall. You can see the list of set walls with \n/mw ms wall list\n and remove walls with \n/mw ms wall remove wallIndex\n, where wall index is the index that is shown in list command.\n\n\nSetting wither locations\n\n\nTo set wither's location, use \n/mw ms wither someTeam\n command. It sets the spawn location of \nsomeTeam\n's wither to your current location. For example, to set the spawnpoint of the green team, use \n/mw ms wither green\n.\n\n\nFinishing the setup\n\n\nTo finish the setup, use command \n/mw ms finish\n. After that, you're ready to use your new map.\n\n\nTo add it to default map pool, make the following change in your\nconfig.json file.\nReplace\n\n\n    \nmaps\n:\n \n[\n\n        \nforest\n,\n \nvolcano\n\n    \n]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwith\n\n\n    \nmaps\n:\n \n[\n\n        \nforest\n,\n \nvolcano\n,\n \nsandcastle\n\n    \n]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsandcastle\n is the name that you set at the beginning to the folder.\n\n\nYou need to restart the server for changes to apply.\n\n\nLanguage\n\n\nYou can change almost all messages Mini Walls sends to players. By default messages are in \nen.properties\n, however, this can be changed in the main config file (\nsee general config\n).\n\n\nSigns\n\n\nYou can create signs for arenas that can be used to join the arena.\n\n\nHere is an example of a sign\n\n\n\n\nAs you can see,\n\n\n\n\nthe first line shows the arena's name\n\n\nthe second shows arena's state, for example Recruiting or In Game (Recruiting = Waiting for Players)\n\n\nthe third shows player count in the arena; it's green when there is room in arena and arena is in lobby\n\n\nthe fourth shows arena's map\n\n\n\n\nCreating a sign\n\n\nCreating such a sign is quite simple. All you need to do is set \nsigns\n to \ntrue\n in \ngeneral config\n and put down a sign with the following format:\n\n\n\n\n[MW]\n\n\nArena name \n(for example MiniWalls-1)\n\n\n(empty)\n\n\n(empty)\n\n\n\n\nHere is an example:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nYou need to have a permission to create a sign. \nSee Permissions\n\n\n\n\nCommands\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncommand\n\n\nexplanation\n\n\npermission\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n/mw join [arena]\n\n\nJoin an arena or open arena joining GUI\n\n\n-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n/mw leave\n\n\nLeave from arena\n\n\n-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n/mw arena [player]\n\n\nSee the arena of specified player.

To update, do the following:\n\n\n\n\nDownload the plugin jar for 1.13 Spigot and put it in your plugins directory. Note that there is a separate jar for 1.13 and 1.8-1.12. You can find the download for 1.13 on plugin's Spigot page.\n\n\nSince chunk storage changed since 1.12, you need to update world data for maps made in 1.12 or lower version. To do that, copy each of your maps to your Minecraft saves directory and open the world once in singleplayer with Minecraft 1.13. After you've done that, move the worlds back to the plugin directory. \nYou don't need to update default maps volcano and forest!\n\n\nDelete default maps (directories \nmap-volcano\n and \nmap-forest\n). The plugin automatically downloads them for 1.13 when the server starts.\n\n\n\n\nSome item names were changed in Minecraft 1.13. If you have some of those in your kits configuration, update them. \nIf you are using default config, delete \nkits.json\n file and a new configuration for 1.13 is generated when server starts.\n \n\n\nHere is a summary of the changes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nold name (1.12 and lower)\n\n\nnew name (1.13)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwool\n\n\nwhite_wool\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwood_pickaxe\n\n\nwooden_pickaxe\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwood_spade\n\n\nwooden_shovel\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwood_axe\n\n\nwooden_axe\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwood_sword\n\n\nwooden_sword\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngold_spade\n\n\ngolden_shovel\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngold_axe\n\n\ngolden_axe\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngold_sword\n\n\ngolden_sword\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngold_helmet\n\n\ngolden_helmet\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngold_chestplate\n\n\ngolden_chestplate\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngold_leggings\n\n\ngolden_leggings\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngold_boots\n\n\ngolden_boots",

Be sure that your map has the following elements that Mini Walls needs:    walls that separate the teams.    place for each wither (there are 4 withers by default)    a lobby area that players spawn in before the game begins; it disappears when the game begins    Copying the files  The next step is to copy the map that you have built to the Mini Walls server. Copy the whole folder and place it in  plugins/MiniWalls  directory.   Note  This name is not shown to players and is used only when configuring the plugin.   Starting the setup  If you haven't already, start your Mini Walls server and join the game. Make sure that you have  walls.admin.map-setup  permission.  Use  /mw ms create yourMapName  command in-game to start the setup. Replace  yourMapName  with the name that you set earlier, for example if your directory name was map-sandcastle, the command should  /mw ms create sandcastle .  After that you should get a message on how to teleport to the setup world. Use the given command to teleport to setup world. Usually it is something like  /mw ms tp MwSetup-mapName-1 .  Setting the display name  Display name is the name of the map that is shown to players. To change it, use the following command while in setup world:  /mw ms display_name MapName .  Setting the lobby spawn  Players that join the game are automatically teleported to lobby spawn location. This location can be changed using  /mw ms lobby_spawn  command. This command changes the lobby spawn location to your current location.  Setting the lobby area  The area that players can be in before the game starts, can be set using command  /mw ms lobby_area . After entering the command, left click the boundaries of the lobby area. Selecting the area works the same as WorldEdit's, but it doesn't matter which item you click with. More information on WorldEdit selection can be found at  http://wiki.sk89q.com/wiki/WorldEdit/Selection#Selecting_cuboids .   Note  After the game starts, all blocks in lobby area are replaced with air.   Setting the spectator spawn  When players die or join during the game, they are first teleported to the spectator spawn location. This location can be changed with  /mw ms spectator_spawn . This command changes the spectator spawn location to your current location.  Setting the border  Players can't move outside the map border. The area that players can be in, can be set using command  /mw ms border . It uses the same selection method as previously explained lobby area command.  Adding walls  To add new walls, use  /mw ms wall add  command and select the boundaries of the wall. You can see the list of set walls with  /mw ms wall list  and remove walls with  /mw ms wall remove wallIndex , where wall index is the index that is shown in list command.  Setting wither locations  To set wither's location, use  /mw ms wither someTeam  command. It sets the spawn location of  someTeam 's wither to your current location. For example, to set the spawnpoint of the green team, use  /mw ms wither green .  Finishing the setup  To finish the setup, use command  /mw ms finish . After that, you're ready to use your new map.  To add it to default map pool, make the following change in your\nconfig.json file.\nReplace       maps :   [ \n         forest ,   volcano \n     ]   with       maps :   [ \n         forest ,   volcano ,   sandcastle \n     ]   sandcastle  is the name that you set at the beginning to the folder.
